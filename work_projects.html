<h3>Peerstreamer</h3>
<p>
PeerStreamer is an open source P2P Media Streaming framework written in C, developed as part of the NAPA-WINE European research project. It includes a streaming engine for the efficient distribution of media streams, a source application for the creation of channels and a player applications to visualize the streams. 
I designed and implemented most of the software besides coordinating occasional contributors.
