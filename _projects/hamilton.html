The Internet-of-Medical-Things (IoMT) is growing in application number and complexity.
The sheer amount of data produced can be further analysed in a centralized way with the more powerful means of the cloud systems.
I have been researching the technologies for massive data gathering in hospitals of lung ventilator data, and their back-up/analysis on cloud back end.
