Colosseum is a wireless network channel emulator with hardware in the loop[[1]](javascript:toggle_display('colosseum-colosseum')) sporting 256 USRP Software Defined Radios designed and released by DARPA in 2019.

 * Despite being a flexible network emulator, standard SDR cannot support 802.11 packet timing requirements; designed, implemented, and deployed an extension using Zylinx System-on-chip boards and OpenWiFi to fully enable Wi-Fi communications.
