The increasing demand for wireless network communication has led to an overcrowding of the wireless spectrum.
As we are running out of available licensed bands, we can exploit spectrum sensing and machine learning to devise intelligent and dynamic wireless spectrum sharing techniques.

 * Research on deep neural networks applied to raw wireless I/Q samples;
 * Design and implementation of intelligent prototypes for spectrum sharing.
