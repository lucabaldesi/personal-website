Delay distribution guarantees and high-probability delivery time reception in *unstructured networks*.
 * Designed a mathematical model and derived its theoretical results for *resource optimization* and *delay minimization* in unstructured network broadcasting. The solution can be easily implemented through neighbour gossiping and the optimized system *improves reception delay by 60% and packet loss by half* in simulated networks [[1]](javascript:toggle_display('delay-Baldesi2017Optimal'))
 * Analytically derived *stochastic bounds* for content delay reception in a mesh distribution network. These are of particular interest for *real-time broadcasting* applications [[2]](javascript:toggle_display('delay-Baldesi2020Infective'))[[3]](javascript:toggle_display('delay-Baldesi2019Properties'))
 * Analitically derived *age of information* metrics in unstructured *vehicular networks* [[4]](javascript:toggle_display('delay-Baldesi2019Keep'))
