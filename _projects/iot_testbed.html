Testing and validating both off-the-shelf and prototype IoT devices require an automated infrastructure.
I have designed, implemented, and deployed a testbed to automatize the initialization of experiments focused on network traffic analysis.

The testbed manages a WiFi network the devices are connected to.
Each device is communicating on a dedicated VLAN to avoid cross-experiment interference.
The devices are registered in the main server and researchers can reserve their usage and automatically start collecting their network traffic through a web interface.
